    Announce: Niecza Perl 6 v22

This is the twenty-second release of Niecza Perl 6, scheduled on the last
Monday of the month.

You can obtain a build of Niecza from [1].  This build contains a
working compiler as a set of .exe and .dll files suitable for use with
Mono or Microsoft .NET.  If you wish to follow latest developments,
you can obtain the source from [2]; however, you still need a
binary for bootstrapping.

Niecza is a Perl 6 compiler project studying questions about the
efficient implementability of Perl 6 features.  It currently targets
the Common Language Runtime; both Mono and Microsoft .NET are known to
work.  On Windows, Cygwin is required for source builds only; see the
README for details.


    List of changes



[Bug fixes]

Range.roll and Range.pick now properly handle ranges which are finer than the
resolution of Num.  (Solomon Foster)



[New features]

Added sub hypot. (Solomon Foster)

Added expmod (modular exponentiation) and is-prime for Int types.  (Solomon
Foster, Larry Wall)

Taking logarithms of integers larger than the largest representable "Num" now
behaves more intelligently.  (Solomon Foster)

Allowed infix:<cmp> to examine the contents of Hash objects.  (Solomon Foster,
Carl MÃ¤sak)



[Internal]

A project has been started to remove global state to allow multiple
interpreters to coexist more easily in a single process, with applications to
sandboxing and improving the compiler/runtime relationship.
